ZenTab - Only allow a single tab open.
-->The first tab activated
-->Don't want it to close all the other tabs without people being notified

How?
onActivated + lastFocused workaround + remove + update



//On startup, close all tabs and open a blank page (about:blank);
-->the currently focused one will have to be a settings page, which can't be saved as a currentTab
//Do not do anything to settings pages, which usually open up in new tabs and are perceived differently than normal pages



chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(function(tabId, changeInfo, tab){ 
    for (var change in changeInfo){
      if(change == "url" && tab.active == true && /chrome:/.test(tab.url) == false){ 
        currentTab = tab; 
        alert("URL has changed to " + changeInfo["url"]);
      }
    } 
}); 


chrome.tabs.onCreated.addListener(function(tab){
  if(typeof currentTab != "undefined" && /chrome:/.text(tab.url) == false){ 
    chrome.tabs.update({url: currentTab.url});
  }  
});
