ZenTab - Only allow a single tab open.
-->The first tab activated
-->Don't want it to close all the other tabs without people being notified

How?
onActivated + lastFocused workaround + remove + update



//On startup, close all tabs and open a blank page (about:blank);
-->the currently focused one will have to be a settings page, which can't be saved as a currentTab
//Do not do anything to settings pages, which usually open up in new tabs and are perceived differently than normal pages
