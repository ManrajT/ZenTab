ZenTab
=======
A chrome extension which forces you to focus by only allowing one tab.


Current problems:
-thumbnail alpha transparency.
-popups opening in main tab
-opening many new tabs will close main tab eventually
-If lone tab is a new tab, and you change the URL, browser crashes and continues to crash afterwards
